python_exploration.py:
Contains the Python code for this Python Exploration assignment.

The Java code based on which python_exploration.py was written is located in
repository Week-1, at paths:
assignment1\src\main\java\csis2450\assignment1\Part2.java
and
assignment1\src\main\java\csis2450\assignment1\Assignment1Arrays.java

NOTE: python_exploration.py formats printed outputs with slightly different
spacing than Part2.java to account for the differences in how the output appears
on the Windows command prompt vs. on the Eclipse console.
